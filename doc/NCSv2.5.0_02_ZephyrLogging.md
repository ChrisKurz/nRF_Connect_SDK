# Zephyr Logging

## Introduction

Zephyr consists of very many software modules, which can be added individually to the own project. The adding is done with the help of CONFIG settings. 
So you can use config - or let's call it kconfig - to add the different Zephyr software modules into your own project. 

In this chapter we will look at the Zephyr Logging library. The implemented logging solution is very extensive. So here we will only look at the very basic functionality. 

In previous chapter we have already seen a simple way to send a message via UART; we used the __printk__ instruction. This is a simple method, but Zephyr Logging offers more functionality. Logging is very common in the Zephyr project. It is used in its software modules and it can individually be enabled. These debug messages can consist of text strings or data, for example debug messages, measurement results or content of varialbes. 

The Zephyr Logging allows debugging during runtime, which is very useful for runtime critical applications like RTOS or debugging Bluetooth connections.
And it can also be used for your own application. We will have a closer look at this in the next example project.

## Required Hardware/Software
- one nRF52 development kit (e.g. nRF52DK, nRF52833DK, or nRF52840DK)
- install the _nRF Connect SDK_ v2.5.0 and _Visual Studio Code_. The description of the installation can be found [here](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/2.5.0/nrf/getting_started/assistant.html#).

## Hands-on step-by-step description 

### Create Project from scratch

1) Create a new project folder.  For example,   c:/MyWorkspace/Logging
2) Add _CMakeLists.txt_ and _prj.conf_ to this folder. In the subfolder __src__ add _main.c_.

    _CMakeLists.txt_
    
       # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
     
       cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.5)
       
       # Find external Zephyr project, and load its settings:
       find_package(Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})

       # Set project name:
       project (MyApp)

       # add sources
       target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)

   _prj.conf_
   
       # keep it empty. We will add later the needed CONFIG symbols.

   
   __NOTE: When setting a CONFIG value ensure that there are no spaces around the equal sign!__
   
   _src/main.c_
   
       #include <zephyr/kernel.h>

       int main(void)
       {
           printk("Testing Zephyr Logging!\n");

           return 0;
       }
  
  Note: The Zephyr Logging software module was added to the project by enabling CONFIG_LOG. The next steps are to enable the logging in our application software.
   
3) Start Visual Studio Code and open the Logging project.

### Include and register the Zephyr Logging

4) Add Zephyr Logging Software Module to your project by adding following lines in __prj.conf__ file. 

   <sup>_prj.conf_ </sup>
   
       # Enable Logging
       CONFIG_LOG=y

5) We need to include the logging header file to get access to the logging functionality. This is done by adding following line in main.c:

   <sup>_src/main.c_ </sup>
   
       #include <zephyr/logging/log.h>
       
5) Before we can use the logging instructions, we have to register the logging for this new software module (the new software module is our own application). This is done by adding following lines before the main function:

   <sup>_src/main.c_ </sup>
   
       /** LOG MODULE REGISTRATION:
           - First parameter: module name
           - Second Parameter (optional): log level
                Following Log-Levels can be used:
                    LOG_LEVEL_NONE  => OFF:     log will not be active. 
                    LOG_LEVEL_ERR   => ERROR:   write only LOG_ERR messages
                    LOG_LEVEL_WRN   => WARNING: write LOG_WRN and LOG_ERR messages
                    LOG_LEVEL_INF   => INFO:    write LOG_INF, LOG_WRN, and LOG_ERR messages
                    LOG_LEVEL_DBG   => DEBUG:   write LOG_DBF, LOG_INF, LOG_WRN, and LOG_ERR messages
       **/
       LOG_MODULE_REGISTER(MyApp,LOG_LEVEL_WRN);

### Adding Logging example messages

6) Now we are ready to create debug outputs in our own application. For test purposes we add the following lines in main function:

   <sup>_src/main.c_ => add in main() function </sup>

           LOG_INF("1-This is a test");
           LOG_ERR("1-ERROR: test");
           LOG_WRN("1-WARNING: test");
           LOG_DBG("1-DEBUG: test");
       
## Testing

7) Build the project, download the code to a development kit, and check the output via the virtual COM port (Settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no partiy, no flow control).

8) Change the log level in the LOG_MODULE_REGISTER instruction and check the debug messages seen on your computer terminal. For example, you can use "nRF Terminal" extension within Visual Studio Code (see previous chapter).       
 

### Using RTT backend for Logging

The debug messages can we sent via different interfaces or also called backends. Zephyr allows to select UART or RTT. By default both backends are enabled. Let's try to use the RTT backend. 

9) Open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and enter "nRF Connect: Connect to RTT". Instead of using command palette, you can also click the play icon in the CONNECTED DEVICES tab. Note that the play icon behind the serial number and the device name will open nRF Terminal using RTT, while the play icon behind the VCOM line opens nRF Terminal using UART. (move mouse on play icon and wait. Context helpd should open.)

10) After selecting "nRF Connect: Connect to RTT" you have to enter a few parameters:
- "Enter device": use the device name here. ThernRFe is a certain nomenclature. In case you enter an unknown device name, you will get a list of valid device names. For example, enter "nRF52840_xxAA".
- "Enter serial number": this is the number that is shown in the CONNECTED DEVICES tab. You find this number also on the sticker on the board controller of your development kit.
- "Choose memory address strategy": use "Automatic search" here.

11) Now, the terminal should run and all RTT messages that are sent via Debug Interface are shown. You are seeing messages, because the default setting in your project is enabled UART and RTT. 
12) Let's change the default settings and do some testing (using UART or RTT for nRF Terminal and enable/disable Logging backends). The Logging backends can be changed by clicking on "Guiconfig". Search for possible "Logging" configs by clicking on "Jumpt to...". Or open directly the folder __Sub Systems and OS Services / Logging / Backends__. Enable/disable the "Enable UART backend" or "Enable Segger J-Link RTT backend". After changing the settings press "Save" button. Note the "Configuration saved to ..." message in the status bar. The settings are stored in the build directory. Take care, because doing a "Pristine build" will erase this folder before it is build again. So using this way means you should only use the "Build" in the ACTIONS tab. 
13) Don't forget to flash the build project before checking the output in the nRF Terminal.
