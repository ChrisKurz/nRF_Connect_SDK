# Getting started: Creating a new Project from existing Sample

## Introduction

## Required Hardware/Software
- install the _nRF Connect SDK_ v2.3.0 and _Visual Studio Code_. The description of the installation can be found [here](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/2.3.0/nrf/getting_started/assistant.html#).

8) Define an _Application name_. The application name is the folder that will be created in your workspace folder. In case, there is already a folder with this name in your wokspace, you will see an error message. In this case select another application name. NOTE: Avoid to use spaces in the application name!
