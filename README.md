# nRF Connect SDK

In this repository you will find several step-by-step hands-on descriptions showing how to use the Nordic Semiconductor _nRF Connect SDK_. 

All hands-on exercises are based on _nRF Connect SDK_ v2.3.0. 

Here is a list of available hands-on exercises:

## Getting started

- [Creating a Project from Scratch](doc/NCSv2.3.0_01_ProjectFromScratch.md) - This hands-on demonstrates how to create a project from scratch.

- [Adding Zephyr Logging](doc/NCSv2.3.0_02_ZephyrLogging.md) - Here we add Zephyr Logging to our project. This allows us to get debug messages during runtime.
